Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of software systems. It involves design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is a discipline that involves applying engineering principles to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems. It encompasses a systematic approach to building high-quality software that meets specified requirements, is reliable, scalable, maintainable, and cost-effective.
On the other hand, traditionl programming  typically refers to the process of writing code to solve specific problems and involves adhoc approaches to coding without formal processes. This processes include lack of documentation for the tasks being undertaken in software development. 

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used by the software engineers to design, develop, and test high-quality software.


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

Requirements:- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design:- Creating high level designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation:- Writing code and building the software as per the design specifications.
Testing:- Conducting various test to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment:- Releasing the system to users.
Maintenance:- Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile model is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change while waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases that make up the software development life cycle that ensures one process has to be completed before the next one can commence.
Each scenario may be preferred depending on the scope of the project, budget, time and human resource available to undertake the project.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements engineering is a systematic process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system.
Requirements engineering is a systematic process that involves gathering, analyzing, documenting, validating, and managing the requirements of a software system to ensure it meets stakeholder needs. It begins with requirements elicitation, this is whereby information is gathered from stakeholders, followed by requirements analysis to refine and prioritize these needs. The requirements are then documented clearly in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) during the specification phase. Validation ensures these requirements are accurate and feasible, and requirements management maintains their relevance and consistency throughout the project lifecycle. This process is crucial for minimizing risks, enhancing communication, and ensuring the final product meets user expectations.

Requirements engineering is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle, as it lays the foundation for all subsequent activities and significantly influences the success of the project.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity in software design is the practice of dividing a software system into distinct, self-contained units or modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the system's functionality. 
Modularity helps in isolation of changes among the different modules within the system, easier and more effective debugging and testing of the modules, simplified understanding and helps developers concentrate on one module at a time.
modularity enhances independent development where teams can simultaneously work on different modules, flexibility in scaling up the system, ease in upgrades and maintenance where the developers can only focus on the modules of concern without having to bring the whole system down.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit testing:- Tests individual units or components of the software, usually at the function or method level. This is done by the developer at the function or method level.
Integration testing:- Tests the interaction between integrated units or components. This is done by the developers to identify issues in integration between modules.
System testing:- Tests the complete and integrated software system. Done by testers to verify that the system meets the specified requirements.
Acceptance testing:- Tests the system's readiness for deployment. This is done by the users of the system to ensure that the software meets the business requirements and is ready for use.
Testing is a fundamental part of software development that ensures the delivery of a high-quality product, minimizes risks, and enhances user satisfaction by identifying and addressing issues at various stages of the development lifecycle.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version Control Systems (VCS) are tools that help manage changes to source code over time. They enable multiple developers to collaborate on a project, track changes, and revert to previous versions when necessary.
Version Control Systems assist in collaboration among different software engineers, tracking historical changes of any software, acts as a back up mechanism as it enables reverting back to older versions incase of an issue.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

A software project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects. 
One of the key responsibilities of a project manager is managing the resources and ensuring timelines are met in deliveling of the software.
Some of the challenges faced include, uncontrolled changes in project scope, delays that leadd to increase in costs, overruns in budget leading in inefficiencies and bottlenecks, miscommunication within the team leading to rework of tasks already done thus causing delays, system integration issues causing system downtime thus posing unreliability concerns.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance involves making changes to existing foftware systems in order to improve their functionality, performance and reliability.
Maintenance is essential as it helps in ensuring software systems are up to date and relevant and are able to meet the changing needs of users and other stakeholders.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Some of the ethical issues that software engineers might face include privacy concerns for example, where a systems collects personal information i.e. bio data, the system functionalities should be guided by the data protection act that ensures this data is not used for the purposes that it was not intended for. Another ethical issue could be around intellectual property for example while building websites, a software engineers could plagiarize someone else's work.
Some of the ways for software engineers to adhere to ethical standards include; familiarize themselves with already existing ethical guidelines and code of conduct within software engineering, collaborate with users and other interested parties in a bid to understand what would be some of their ethical concerns through welcoming them to continuously review and give feedback on the softwares being developed, ensure data security within their systems to ensure no unauthorized access to the system by anyone.
